# Salad Dressing Recipe Generator App

A simple but useful tool which presents the user with a large variety of common ingredients for salad dressing.  The user picks one (or more for aromatics) ingredient from each category, depending what they have on hand.  Once they have chosen all the ingredients, they click a button and a recipe is generated using a template string and interpolating in the selected ingredients.

First a dressing category is chosen ( vinaigrette, creamy )

For vinaigrette:
    Vinegar
    Oil
    Mustard (in every recipe, no need for user to choose it)
    Aromatics
    Season with S & P (also in every recipe)
